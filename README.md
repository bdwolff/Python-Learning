# Python-Learning
Project Based Learning space for python language

To learn Python I wanted to create some random data sets. The first project will create random RGB values in a 300x400 grid and store them in a CSV file. The second will import the CSV file and create an image of the random RGB values.

This is a repeat of a project I did several years ago as I learned Python. What I found interesting then was the predominance of Yellows in the colors. We will see how it turns out this time. I believe the way I implemented Random changed from then to now.
